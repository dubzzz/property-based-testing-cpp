# Property Based Testing in C++ using RapidCheck

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dubzzz/property-based-testing-cpp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dubzzz/property-based-testing-cpp)[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/ghb9mpyk1m46q6yf?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/dubzzz/property-based-testing-cpp)

This repository wants to demonstrate through basic and simple examples the benefits of using property-based-testing in addition to unit-tests.

It relies on ```GoogleTest``` and ```RapidCheck``` frameworks.

```RapidCheck```'s generators are described at:
